1.Introduction
1.1 Description
This is a password based door lock system. This a microcontroller based project which created a secure access for a door which needs a password to open the door. The system will be used in places where we need more security. It can be used in door, lockers, main gates of house and ATM etc. The system uses a seven segment display array to show the password, a matrix keypad to enter the numbers/password and operates a relay (to activate the solenoid valve) for locking and unlocking purpose. The system alarms through a buzzer if a wrong password is entered for 3 times continuously and the system resumes for 1 hour.
1.2 Features
The user must enter a correct password to gain access.
The system uses a seven segment display array to show the password, a matrix keypad to enter the numbers/password and operates a relay for locking and unlocking purpose. 
The system alarms through a buzzer.
If a wrong password is entered for 3 times continuously and the system resumes for 1 hour.

3.2 Components
3.2.1 Sensors
4*4 Keypad: To give user input i.e, a four digit password 
Potentiometer: Here it can be used to vary the sound of the buzzer.
Push buttons: Acts as a door locker for opening and closing of door.
Led sensor: To indicate the correct password. If a correct assword is given the led is turned on by a relay placed nearby.
3.2.2 Accuators
Relay: As soon as correct password is entered the relay is activated. This is indicated by a LED which is placed near the relay. Also used for locking and unlocking purpose.
Buzzer: It is used to notify if a wrong password is applied.
3.3.3 Other components
Microcontroller: Here Atmega16 is used. It controls al the operations
7 segment Led: To display the four digit password entered.

5 Applications
1. This simple circuit can be used at residential places to ensure better safety.
2. It can be used at organizations to ensure authorized access to highly secured places.
3. With a slight modification this Project can be used to control the switching of loads through password.
